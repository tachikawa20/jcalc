# Compiling

### Default compilers
On a modern system (Windows or *NIX): Every compiler that has C++11 support.
On an ancient system (DOS): DJGPP for Linux (C++99) is required. Remember, no multilanguage support.

### Language & Locale
To compile the program in a specific language, change the header files for "main.cpp" and "jmath.h". For example, default is "en_lang.h". To compile in Japanese, substitute that
for "ja_lang.h".
