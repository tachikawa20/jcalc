<h4>First Steps&nbsp;</h4>
<p><em>"After downloading the (.zip) file containing the program for the correct operating system, what now?"</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip it using a tool such as WinRAR, 7zip, or even the one included in your Operating System.</li>
<li>There, you will find 3 files. <strong>The program itself</strong> (.exe file for Windows, but for *NIX systems such as Linux or MacOS it has no extension at all), a <strong>LICENSE.TXT</strong> (that says what you can do or not do with the program) and finally, <strong>VERSION.TXT</strong> (a file that you can read to know more about the version of the program that has just been installed.</li>
<li>To run the program, (on Windows) you only have to click on the executable file (.exe) "JCALC.EXE", or just simply run on the command prompt. Easy. On a *NIX system, however, you may have to open the program on the console, and run it by typing "./jcalc".</li>
</ol>
<p><em>"And... now what? I already know this stuff, alright?!"</em></p>
