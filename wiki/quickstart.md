## English

### First Steps

*"After downloading the (.zip) file containing the program for the correct operating system, what now?"*
1. Unzip it using a tool such as WinRAR, 7zip, or even the one included in your Operating System.
2. There, you will find 3 files. **The program itself** (.exe file for Windows, but for \*NIX systems such as Linux or MacOS it has no extension at all), a **LICENSE.TXT** (that says what you can do or not do with the program) and finally, **VERSION.TXT** (a file that you can read to know more about the version of the program that has just been installed.
3. To run the program, (on Windows) you only have to click on the executable file (.exe) "JCALC.EXE", or just simply run on the command prompt. Easy. On a *NIX system, however, you may have to open the program on the console, and run it by typing "./jcalc".

*"And... now what? I already know this stuff, alright?!"*
